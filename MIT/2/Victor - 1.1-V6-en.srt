Hi, I'm Victor Chernozhukov, professor in the Department of Economics and Center for

1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,200
Statistics at MIT.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,510
My research in teaching for this econometrics and

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,330
mathematical statistics was much of recent efforts

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,650
due added to the use of machine learning methods for causal Inference.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,860
In this module, we will discuss regression in classical and modern versions.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,448
Regression analysis is about discovering correlations between the outcome,

7
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:24,777
y and the set of regressors x, which sometimes are also called features.

8
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:27,792
In this module, y is always the real random variable and

9
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:32,166
x is the vector of random variables, with components denoted by X1 through Xp.

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,350
Where we always assume that a concept of one is included as one of the components.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,500
We denote the transpose of a vector by the prime sign.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,130
For example, suppose our y is hourly wage which varies across workers, and

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,660
x is the retro regressors which include variables that measure education,

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,190
experience gender, and other job relevant characteristics.

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,330
When we are interested in the effect of a particular component of x and

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,640
y, we show partition axis for D and W, where D will be the target regressor and

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,340
W will be called the controls of components.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,140
The purpose of the regression analysis is to characterize the statistical

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,420
relation y to x.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,000
Namely, we want to answer two question.

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,100
Question one, or the prediction question.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,278
How can we use x to predict y well?

23
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:17,700
Question two, or the inference question.

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,990
How does the predicted value of y change if we change a component of x,

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,160
holding the rest of the components of x fixed?

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,297
In our wage example,

27
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:28,468
the predictions questions becomes how to use job relevant characteristics,

28
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:33,260
such as education, experience, gender and others, to best predict the wage?

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,280
An inference question becomes for example, how gender affects the predicted wage?

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,950
This allows us to uncover gender discrimination if it exists.

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,060
In this module, we will discuss classical and

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,650
modern regression tools that answer these two questions.

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,400
We'll now give a preview of some of the empirical findings from a case

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,870
study in which we will examine our wage example

35
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,010
using data from the US current population survey in 2012 for single workers.

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,920
We will address the two questions post.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,290
Number one, we will construct a prediction rule for

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,970
a hourly wage which depends on the job relevant characteristics linearly.

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,220
We will assess the quality of the prediction rule

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,505
using our sample prediction performance.

41
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:12,324
Number two, we will find that an average women get about $2 less an hourly wage

42
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:15,945
than men with the same experience and other recorded characteristics.

43
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:18,635
This is called the gender wage gap in labor economics and

44
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,805
measures in part gender paid discrimination
